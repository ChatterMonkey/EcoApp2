<h1>Reducing  Plastic Waste</h1>


<h3> Plastic is ubiquitous in our lives. We buy a constant stream of plastic, almost half of which serves as packaging. What happens with all of this plastic? 50% is designated for single use items which are only used for a few minutes before we toss it away to pollute the earth for hundreds of years.<sup>1</sup> Our waste management system is unable to contain and recycle much of this plastic. In fact, 8 million tons of plastic each year are dumped into the world’s oceans.<sup>1</sup> One report predicts that by 2050, there will be more pounds of plastic then pounds of fish in the ocean.<sup>2</sup> Plastic strangles, chokes, and suffocates wildlife. We humans are victims of our own pollution as well, since every year, you ingest and inhale more than 74,000 bits of micro plastic.<sup>3</sup> Most of the plastic that we use is unnecessary and easily avoidable. Below are categories of disposable plastic waste you should avoid using. If you avoid using them by bypassing them all together or using a reusable version, reward your self with eco points by selecting the action under <a href="actions.html">the actions page</a>.
</h3>





<a name="plasticbags"></a>
<h3>Single Use Plastic Bags</h3>

<p>Most plastic that is produced is only used for a short period of time. Plastic bags for example, are only used for 12 minutes on average!<sup>4</sup> That is just an instant compared to the hundreds of years that that bag will exist.<sup>4</sup> Furthermore, out of all the 100 billion bags people in the US use every year, only one bag in 200 actually gets recycled, a process which damages the polymers and can only be done once or twice.<sup>4</sup> <br> All over the world, a million plastic bags are being used per minute.<sup>4</sup>
 If bags don’t get recycled, what happens to them? Mostly, these bags escape into the environment, and end up in the ocean where they are eaten by animals.<sup>5</sup> Plastic bags kill their victims slowly and painfully by staying trapped in the animal’s guts and slowly starving the animal to death.<sup>5</sup> Then, once the animal dies, the body decays, releasing the plastic back into the ocean to continue its silent murder for 1,000 more years.<sup>5</sup>
Luckily, you have a lot of control over if you use plastic bags. I am sure that you already have reusable shopping bags, and reusable sandwich bags are an inexpensive alternative to disposable plastic sandwich bags.
But there is always the option of simply avoiding the disposable bag. You can pack your sandwich in a reusable container, and take a jar or cloth bag to the bulk section of a grocery store (they will weigh it for you and subtract that weight from your purchase!). You can also easily reuse bags that you use to buy produce at a farmers market - just keep them in your car with your grocery bags so you will always have them on hand.
</p>








<a name="plasticcontainers"></a>
<h3>Single Use Plastic Containers</h3>

    <p> Single use plastics can take the form of not only plastic bags of all kinds, but also plastic take out containers (clamshells) and drink cups from places like Starbucks and bubble tea stores. For example, plastic water bottles are a huge source of waste. We buy a million bottles a minute.<sup>6</sup> And, within the United States, only 30% of these bottles are recycled <sup>7</sup> Most of the time plastic bottles are avoidable. You could use a reusable bottle instead. If you have to buy a drink while out, choose a metal can. If you make sure it gets to a recycling bin, you are doing a huge service to the environment. Metal cans be recycled an indefinite number of times and 70% of aluminum cans are made from recycled metal in the first place.<sup>8</sup> Places like Starbucks will make your drink in your own container. Check on Amazon for a reusable container or just bring a reusable container and a reusable straw. Even bubble tea stores will almost always make your drink in your own container. The market is flooded with plastic containers, but you <u>can</u> find ways to avoid them.
</p>




<a name="otherplastic"></a>
<h3>Other Single Use Plastics</h3>

<p>

Things such as plastic wrap and straws have reusable equivalents. Keep a set of portable utensils in your car or backpack to avoid disposable silverware. You know which single use plastics you use the most and you can sidestep them or replacing them. It might be easier to just ignore the consequences of plastic waste then to act on the truth, but plastic waste doesn't evaporate. If you are not careful, your personal legacy a hundred years from now may be thousands of pieces of plastic polluting the earth.

<h1> Energy Conservation </h1>

<h3>Why should we conserve energy? In our world, producing energy and converting into different forms (such as growing food and livestock) creates pollution, greenhouse gasses, and often toxic chemicals at every step of the way. For example, one pound of beef requires 2,464.56 gallons of water to produce.<sup>9</sup> That water was purified and pumped by machines that ran on oil and gas and polluted the air. Additionally, beef production releases methane (an extremely potent greenhouse gas) and requires huge amounts of chemicals to grow the feed for the animals. <br> Unfortunately, even if you use green energy to power your home or use an electric vehicle, our consumer driven world is powered by dirty energy that pollutes the earth and harms the living things on it, including us. We can deal with this by reducing our energy usage to minimize our negative impact. Keep in mind that conserving water is directly related to conserving energy - a huge amount of energy is used to make water usable. Overall, here are some actions you can take to reduce the amount of water and energy you use.</h3>

<h2>Transportation</h2>





<a name="carpool"></a>
<h3>Car pool</h3>

<p>Car pool to enjoy more social time, less time behind the wheel, faster HOV lanes, and a huge cut in your personal energy use. Pollution from cars is also a serious problem, Every year, 4.6 million people die from air pollution<sup>10</sup> and most of these deaths are linked directly to pollutants from cars.
</p>






<a name="pt"></a>
<h3>Public transportation </h3>

<p> Not only do many buses and trains run on more eco friendly fuel then the gasoline our cars guzzle, but these forms of transportation are inherently more efficient. For example, a bus releases just 20% of the carbon monoxide released by a person in a car per passenger mile.<sup>11</sup>
</p>




<a name="bikingwalking"></a>
<h3>Biking and walking </h3>

<p>What more is there to say? The average American spends 5% of their time outside,<sup>12</sup> and many don’t venture outside at all. Enjoy some exercise, fresh air, and say goodbye to your personal four wheeled pollutant machine. Choose to bike or walk to somewhere you would otherwise drive to.
<p>




   <a name="foodwaste"></a>
<h3>Eat leftovers
</h3>

<p>Imagine a huge field of crops  -> tomatoes, wheat, corn or something like that. Then separate 30 - 40% of that field and dump it directly into a landfill, and you have just envisioned what happens every day in America. We waste 30-40% of our food, and half of that waste happens at home. Why is so much just thrown away? Most of the tossing happens for purely cosmetic reasons - driven by our demand for designer food. We buy more than we need and we don’t eat what we buy. Take actions to reduce your food waste and you will hugely reduce your impact.
</p>


<a name="water"></a>
<h3>Conserve water by taking a shower instead of a bath </h3>

<p>
   I am sure you have heard this one - with a high efficiency shower head, even a longer shower (though less than 18 minutes) is more efficient than filling the bathtub.<sup>13</sup> The shorter the shower, the bigger the savings.

</p>


   <a name="vegetarian"></a>

<h3>Choose to eat vegetarian </h3>

   <p> This is a big one. If you don’t remember my spiel on beef, please scroll up and read it again. I can share all sorts of horrifying statistics on the water and energy that goes into livestock production, but here is the main takeaway - it is much more efficient to grow food and eat it, then to grow food, feed it to an animal and wait for the animal to efficiently convert feed into meat and then kill and eat the animal. Here are the ratios of feed: meat for various animals, which reveal how many pounds of feed is required to produce one pound of edible meat:
   </p>




<ul>
 <li>4.5 lbs feed: 1 lb chicken</li>
 <li>9.4 lbs feed: 1 lb pork</li>
 <li>25 lbs feed: 1lb beef</li>
</ul>




This article sums up the issue rather nicely “With 75% of all agricultural land used for animal production—and more than a third of global calories and half of global protein inefficiently used as animal feed —the impact of increasing global meat consumption is monumental.”<sup>14</sup>





<a name="eatlocal"></a>
<h3> Eat local produce</h3>


   <p> Your food racks up miles. In one study, an apple that ended up in a grocery store travelled 1,555 miles, whereas an apple that ended up in the farmers market traveled 77 miles. Even disregarding the dubious freshness of food that has traveled that far, consider the environmental impact of shipping every bite you eat from 1,555 miles away. As these numbers go to show, choosing to buy from a farmers market instead of a conventional store greatly reduces the distance your food has traveled. <p>







<a name="clothes"></a>
<h3> Wash clothes in cold water </h3>

   <p>The average american family of 4 washes 400 loads of clothes in their washing machine every year.<sup>15</sup> Clearly, any improvement would go a long way. However, 75-90% of the energy involved in washing clothes goes into heating the water!<sup>15</sup> Unless you are fighting sickness within your household, you likely have no reason to wash your clothes in hot water. Try it sometimes - your clothes might thank you by lasting longer.<sup>16</sup>

    <li><a href="https://civileats.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/kreith_1991_water_inputs_in_ca_food_production-excerpt.pdf"> The number of gallons used to produce 1 pound of beef is a hotly contested topic. This is in part because the beef industry has a huge stake in the issue and also because a large factor in water use is how much the feed crop is iregated, a number that veryies dramatically from place to place. Between actual variations in data, and figures provided by industry leaders that most researchers believe have been significantly lowered, there is a wide range of values for the number of gallons of water needed to produce a pound of beef. These range from 441 gallons (sponsored by the beef industry), to 12,000 gallons from one environmental study. I sifted through a lot of articles, quickely relizing that there was a lot of exaddration and propaganda on both sides. The following document however, is from the Water Education Foundation, a nonprofit based in sacremento, CA. Their report looks at local data, and seems to provide the most relevant and non baised answer of all of the papers I have read. They place Californian beef at using 2464 gallons of water per pound of edible beef, a number which the vast majority of reports hover around. https://civileats.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/kreith_1991_water_inputs_in_ca_food_production-excerpt.pdf</a></li>
